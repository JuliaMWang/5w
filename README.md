Back with HW 5 tests

So last time I tried to be fancy and automate the tests, but I wrote stuff differently
than liTERally everyone so it was pretty bad.

So here's the raw test commands, hope they help!

To Use:

For each test .in file,

Run $./amazon database.txt

Copy paste the entirety of the .in file into the command line, including the last newline

Compare the .out file with the correctx.out file, and make sure your command line outputs 
are all good too
